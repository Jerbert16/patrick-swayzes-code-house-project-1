# Everday Stargazing App
Everyday stargazing made easy for the everyday amateur stargazer. 

## Description
Check out our brand new Everyday Stargazer app for closer access to stars near you. All you have to do is give your location (or let the app detect it for you) and then in one click you have an exact map of the stars along with current weather at your fingertips.
*Location permissions may be required.

## User Story
AS AN amateur stargazer

I WANT to know from my vantage point on Earth what constellations I can see on a clear and dark night

SO THAT I can enjoy a cool evening outside and make memories with my family

It is complete when the application detects the users location on earth and produces current weather information and an image of what stars they can expect to see on a clear and dark night.

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN an app with form inputs for location

WHEN the user provides their address or in the alternative when the app detects the user’s location on Earth

THEN the app converts their location into latitude and longitude

WHEN the app is informed of the user’s latitude and longitude

THEN the app renders an accurate depiction of the stars in the sky from that vantage point on Earth along with current weather in that location
