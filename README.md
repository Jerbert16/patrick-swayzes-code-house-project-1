# Amateur Stargazer
Stargazing App made easy for the everyday amateur Stargazer. 

## Description
Words words words words.
*Location permissions may be required.

## User Story
As an amateur stargazer, I want to know from my vantage point on Earth what constellations I can see on a clear and dark night so that I can enjoy a cool evening outside and make memories with my family.

It is complete when the application detects the users location on earth and produces current weather information and an image of what stars they can expect to see on a clear and dark night.
