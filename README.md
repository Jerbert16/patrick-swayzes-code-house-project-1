# Amateur Stargazer
Daily Task Manager

## Description
A simply designed task manager application that allows a user to input and save tasks or appointments for every hour of their business day. For user-friendly readability, the present time displays red, while all future ahead are shown in green, and any hour blocks that have past, are subtly taken out of the user's focus using a grey background.  

## User Story
As an amateur stargazer, I want to know from my vantage point on Earth what constellations I can see on a clear and dark night so that I can enjoy a cool evening outside and make memories with my family.

It is complete when the application detects the users location on earth and produces current weather information and an image of what stars they can expect to see on a clear and dark night.

## Acceptance Criteria
